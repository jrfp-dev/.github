# 🧪 JRFP — JoãoRicardoFP’s Laboratory  
> Research, experimentation, and modern software development.

Welcome to **JRFP**, the technical laboratory of **JoãoRicardoFP**.  
This is where experiments, tests, prototypes, and creative explorations live — reflecting my continuous evolution as a full-stack developer.

Here you will find:

- 🔬 **Experimental projects**  
- 🧩 **Demos, micro-apps, and utilities**  
- ⚙️ **Stacks, boilerplates, and personal infrastructure**  
- 📚 **Studies, playgrounds, and conceptual explorations**  
- 🚀 **Internal tools that may grow into full projects**  

Repositories here are not “final versions,” but **discovery cycles** — ideas that grow, break, evolve, and transform.

## 📌 Purpose of the Laboratory

To create an open technical environment where I can:

- test emerging technologies  
- develop internal tools  
- validate architectural concepts  
- study modern patterns  
- build small experiments that may inspire larger solutions  

JRFP exists to support my work in:

- **Evenesy** — creative and web design studio  
- **joaoricardofp.com** — personal and professional identity  
- **Eonys** — a platform currently **in development**
